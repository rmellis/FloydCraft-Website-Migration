										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a list of all cheat detected and a description of what it is.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>AirJump :<br />
</strong>Allow to jump on the air.</p>
<p><strong>AirPlace :<br />
</strong>Allow to place block on air or next to liquid (instead of replace liquid).</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Knockback / Velocity / KB-Reduceur :<br />
</strong>Allow you to don&#8217;t flinch when you get hitting with object enchanted knockback . Feared in pitchout but very easy to see. Warning: some people don&#8217;t move because of lag, because it&#8217;s the player that send his position, so the server wait where the player got.</p>
<p><strong>AntiPotion :<br />
</strong>Remove bad potion effect like poison or blindness. Info: The player send packet according to the time of the potion effect. This say to the server to pass the time, and so remove the effect.</p>
<p><strong>AutoClick :<br />
</strong>Manage client click. Some client can just do like the player have 12 CPS constant (real player can do it also, so undetectable), but other allow just to go up to 20 CPS. Nb: CPS = Click Per Second.</p>
<p><strong>AutoSteal :<br />
</strong>Allow player to quickly edit inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Blink :<br />
</strong>Fake lag. Allow player to get teleported thanks to lag.</p>
<p><strong>Chat :<br />
</strong>Detect spam.</p>
<p><strong>Critical :<br />
</strong>Allow to always do critical damage, even on the ground without jumping.</p>
<p><strong>FastBow :<br />
</strong>Shoot a lot of arrow in no much time. Visible with the lag make by the player (spawn of many entities) and if you are spectate his inventory, you will see his bow self destruct.</p>
<p><strong>FastEat / AutoEat :<br />
</strong>Eat item instantly (and change slot of hand). Usually use in quick combat.</p>
<p><strong>FastLadder :<br />
</strong>Make the player moving very quickly when moving up on ladders.</p>
<p><strong>FastPlace / FastBreak :<br />
</strong>Place or break block faster than normal player.</p>
<p><strong>FastStairs :<br />
</strong>Equivalent of &#8216;SpeedHack&#8217; but for stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Fly :<br />
</strong>Allow player to fly. Some cheat make the player moving too fast, so it can be detected as Speed. There is also FlyNCP to fly on server who have NoCheatPlus plugin.</p>
<p><strong>ForceField / KillAura :</strong><br />
<em>In Negativity, both are together, but there is a different between us</em></p>
<p>KillAura make the player rotating to attack the player, and sometimes it contains &#8220;Reach&#8221; to hit someone at 5 or more blocks. ForceField simplify the attack. It allow to hit multiple entities at the same times without looking her.</p>
<p><strong>GroundSpoof :</strong><br />
Fake ground value of player to prevent fall damage or other features. Used for NoFall, Fly &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>InventoryMove :<br />
</strong>When you walk/sprint, you can open and click on your inventory (and always walk/sprint).</p>
<p><strong>Jesus / WaterWalk :<br />
</strong>Allow to walk or jump on water.</p>
<p><strong>NoFall :<br />
</strong>Remove damage effect from falling. Normally, everytime that your falling, your &#8220;fall damage&#8221; increase. This cheat don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><strong>NoPitchLimit :<br />
</strong>You can look 360° around you (in all direction)</p>
<p><strong>NoSlowDown :<br />
</strong>Move on soul sand like on basic blocs.</p>
<p><strong>NoWeb :<br />
</strong>Make you walk on cobweb exactly like on ground</p>
<p><strong>Nuker :<br />
</strong>Remove lot of block around her at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>PingSpoof :<br />
</strong>Fake the player ping.</p>
<p><strong>Phase :<br />
</strong>Make you walking ON blocks (or pass through it).</p>
<p><strong>Regen :<br />
</strong>Regen faster. Work exactly like AntiPotion.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffold :<br />
</strong>Make you placing block just behind you, but without looking it.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak :<br />
</strong>Allow you to sneak but you are moving as quickly as if you wasn&#8217;t sneaking</p>
<p><strong>Speed :<br />
</strong>Move faster.</p>
<p><strong>Spider :<br />
</strong>Allow you to walk on a wall like you walk on ground.</p>
<p><strong>Step :<br />
</strong>Teleport player on player, like if they have jump, but more than 1 block.</p>
<p><strong>Timer :<br />
</strong>Make the player game faster. Exactly like the player was in temporal loop, which make it does 1 minute in 10 seconds for other</p>
<p><strong>XRay :<br />
</strong>You only see diamond, emerald, iron, gold, restone and lapis (and other important block like spawner or new ore). All other blocks are just transparent.</p>The post <a href="https://cdn.floydcraft.co.uk/infomation/list-of-all-hacks-that-are-now-blocked-as-of-18th-april-2021/">list of all hacks that are now blocked as of 18th April 2021</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdn.floydcraft.co.uk"> 𝙁𝙡𝙤𝙮𝙙 𝘾𝙧𝙖𝙛𝙩 </a>.]]></content:encoded>

The most up to date version that is compatible with your version of Minecraft. These are tested versions and works as intended.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WorldGuard 6.1.2 OR LOWER</b>
<ul>
<li><b>NOT SUPPORTED, PLEASE UPGRADE, READ BELOW FOR RECOMMENDED VERSIONS</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 6.2.0
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft:</b> From 1.7 up to 1.11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 6.2.2
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft</b>: 1.12</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 7.0.0
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft: </b>1.13</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 7.0.3
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft: </b>From 1.14 to 1.15</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 7.0.4
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft: </b>1.16</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Can I bypass flag with permissions?</b><br />
You can bypass any flag by using the following permission node:</p>
<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.&lt;flag&gt;</p>
<p>If your permission plugin supports wildcars they can by used to block all custom flags in region using:</p>
<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.*</p>
<p><b>Flag is not working:</b><br />
Make sure you do not have permissions for the following permission node:</p>
<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.&lt;flag&gt;</p>
<p>Also make sure you have use-player-move-event set to true in WorldGuard config.</p>
<p>Please also note that if you are OP you have all the permissions, meaning that you are bypassing every flag the plugin provides. This can look like the plugin is not working.</p>
<p>Also /rg bypass doesn&#8217;t work, at least yet.</p>
<p><b>Respawn-location flag is not working:</b><br />
Read up the flag is not working part first before trying this. Some other plugins are known to cause problems with respawn-location flag by choosing some other location to respawn the player instead of the location provided by the flag.</p>
<p>If you are using Essentials you can fix this by changing the respawn-listener-priority to lowest or low in the Essentials config.</p>
<p><b>Can I use multiple commands?</b><br />
Yes, use comma to separate them.</p>
<p><b>Can I get the player&#8217;s username when executing a command?</b><br />
You can use the %username% placeholder</p>
<p><b>What if my command contains commas?</b><br />
Wrap the command in quotation marks and it will be seen as one whole command.</p>
<p><b>A word about custom commands</b><br />
Custom commands do not work as they are not &#8220;real&#8221; commands. Using plugins like Skript where you can define your own commands are seen as &#8220;fake&#8221; commands and their existence is unknown.</p>
<p><b>What are the values for walk-speed?</b><br />
The flag uses same values as Minecraft does. The default value being 0.2</p>
<p><b>What are the values for play-sounds?</b><br />
These values depend on your Minecraft server version. Any value that works with /playsound works as value here.</p>
<p><b>Server crashes when using teleport commands in command-on-entry or in command-on-exit:</b><br />
Using teleport commands is not supported and there is a special flags for them; teleport-on-entry and teleport-on-exit. These flags are more careful when teleporting the player around and tries to prevent any circular teleport loops.</p>
<p><b>When using keep-inventory flag my inventory gets duplicated:</b><br />
This is not the plugins fault and some other plugin is conflicting with the flag.</p>
<p><b>I want to give a player permission when they enter a region.</b><br />
You should <b>NEVER </b>in any situation to use command-on-entry flag&#8217;s to give out permissions. Instead, you should use the following extension for LuckPerms: <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/LuckPerms/ExtraContexts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/LuckPerms/ExtraContexts</a></p>

WeatherNews is a small, simple yet powerful plugin that shows weather information in chat.<br />
Every time the weather changes it will be announced, It will explain in detail what&#8217;s happening, how long it will stay that way and what&#8217;s most likely to be next.<br />
This plugin was originally made by Namarius in early 2011, I used it back on Minecraft 1.2 back in 2012 and it was a great addition for a survival server but unfortunately it had not received an update since 2012.<br />
I&#8217;ve updated this best i can and made some nice adjustments including two new variables for Italic and Bold text aswell as a modern new look, see example screenshots below&#8230;<br />
&#8216; Enjoy!​</p>
<p><img class="bbCodeImage LbImage" src="https://proxy.spigotmc.org/dfa98b5280195c588fb2060b2b40be7670c339c6?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F6gv4OHE.png" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/6gv4OHE.png" /><br />
When you Download this you will get a .zip file, open that and select the version that you need for your server, Then simply drop the .jar file in the plugins folder.</p>

<div>Create custom void worlds with a powerful and lightweight generator system that allows you to add countless empty worlds.<br />
Voidgenerator is made to handle all aspects of how you create void worlds.<br />
Now includes full biome control!​</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><i>This plugin should be compatible with most world management+creation plugins. It will not override any vanilla/default generators but it will establish its own tools to create the worlds defined by you. (This will never override any existing worlds and only be taken into effect once new chunks get created.)<br />
</i>​</div>

<div class="ToggleTriggerAnchor bbCodeSpoilerContainer"><button class="button bbCodeSpoilerButton ToggleTrigger Tooltip JsOnly" style="margin: 5px 0px; padding: 0px 10px; font: 600 12px / 36px 'droid sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: #535353; background-color: #d9d9d9; border-width: 0px; border-top-color: #ffffff; border-radius: 3px; text-align: center; outline: none; display: inline-block; cursor: pointer; box-sizing: border-box; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px -2px 0px inset; appearance: none; height: 36px; max-width: 99%;" type="button" data-target="&gt; .SpoilerTarget">Spoiler: <span class="SpoilerTitle">Video tutorials</span></button></div>
</div>
<p>STEP 1<br />
<b>Setting up the bukkit.yml</b> <b>(</b> recommended <b>)</b></p>
<div>First, open up the <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">bukkit.yml</span> file from your server directory and go to the end of the file. Here we add the worlds we want the plugin to generate. This snipped needs to be added to the end of the file:</p>
<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode">
<div class="type">Code (YAML):</div>
<div class="code">worlds:<br />
&lt;worldname&gt;:<br />
generator: VoidGenerator:&lt;biome&gt;</div>
</div>
<p>• <b>&lt;worldname&gt;</b> &#8211; This is the name of the world you want the plugin to work in.<br />
• <b>&lt;biome&gt;</b> &#8211; is an optional parameter. Leaving the value out, is equivalent to specifying <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">THE_VOID</span> as the biome to use. If you want the vanilla biome grid, simply apply the value <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">VANILLA</span>. All possible biomes for the latest spigot version can be found <a class="externalLink" href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br />
• <b>Void darkness</b> &#8211; start at around Y=64, if you want them to start at Y=0, set the <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">level-type</span> in the <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">server.properties</span> file to <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">FLAT</span>.</p>
<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode">
<div class="type">Code (PROPERTIES):</div>
<div class="code">level-type=FLAT</div>

</div>
<p>STEP 2<br />
<b>Worldmanagement</b></p>
<div>If you are using VoidGenerator for your default world and are not using any worldmanagement plugins like Mutliverse, you are done here. Reload your server and the plugin should function as intended.<br />
In case you are running a world management plugin like <a class="externalLink" href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Multiverse</a> this is important for you. If you are not using Multiverse use the corresponding commands from your plugin of choice.<br />
You have three different choices, <b>Create</b> a world, <b>Import</b> a world and/or use the <b>default world</b>.</p>
<p><b>Create:</b> Use the following command, when creating a new World:</p>
<div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeHtml">
<div class="type">HTML:</div>
<div class="code">/mv create &lt;worldname&gt; &lt;env&gt; -g VoidGenerator:&lt;biome&gt; -t FLAT</div>
</div>
<p>• <b>&lt;worldname&gt;</b> &#8211; This is the name of the world you want the plugin to work in.<br />
• <b>&lt;env&gt;</b> &#8211; represents the environment of the world, use <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">/mv env</span> to see a list of all possible environments. Most common ones are <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">NORMAL</span> and <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">NETHER</span><br />
• <b>&lt;biome&gt;</b> &#8211; is an optional parameter. Leaving the value out, is equivalent to specifying <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">THE_VOID</span> as the biome to use. If you want the vanilla biome grid, simply apply the value <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">VANILLA</span>. All possible biomes for the latest spigot version can be found <a class="externalLink" href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br />
• <b>Void darkness</b> start at around Y=64, if you want them to start at Y=0, set the <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">level-type</span> in the <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">server.properties</span> file to <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">FLAT</span>.</p>
<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode">
<div class="type">Code (PROPERTIES):</div>
<div class="code">level-type=FLAT</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Import:</b> Use the following command, when creating a new World:</p>
<div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeHtml">
<div class="type">HTML:</div>
<div class="code">/mv import &lt;worldname&gt; &lt;env&gt; -g VoidGenerator:&lt;biome&gt; -t FLAT</div>
</div>
<p>• <b>&lt;worldname&gt;</b>[/COLOR] represents the name of the world you want to generate.<br />
• <b>&lt;env&gt;</b>[/COLOR] represents the environment of the world, use <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">/mv env</span> to see a list of all possible environments. Most common ones are <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">NORMAL</span> and <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">NETHER</span><br />
• <b>&lt;biome&gt;</b>[/COLOR] is optional. Leaving the value out, is equivalent to specifying <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">THE_VOID</span> as the biome to use. All possible biomes for the latest spigot version can be found <a class="externalLink" href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>​</p></div>
<p><b>Default world:</b> We already specified the generator in the <span class="BBcodeInlineCode">bukkit.yml</span> file. But we also need to change the generator in our multiverse world file to:</p>
<div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode">
<div class="type">Code (YAML):</div>
<div class="code">generator: VoidGenerator:&lt;biome&gt;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>STEP 3<br />
<b>Restart</b></p>
<div>Restart your server for all the changes to take effect. If you configured everything correctly, the generator will work in all newly created chunks. If you still have issues, visit the discord linked down below to get help quickly.​</div>

<div>To be notified of an updated plugin version on spigot you need this permission:</p>
<p><i><b>voidgenerator.notifyupdate</b><br />
The permission applied to operators by default</i>​</div>
<p><img class="bbCodeImage LbImage" src="https://proxy.spigotmc.org/8a07a65869d6bc7c6bd5807909a97a3ca0b788bd?url=https%3A%2F%2Fypict.de%2Fimg%2Fupload%2FDilpFrXOdwlZ1riZ.png" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://ypict.de/img/upload/DilpFrXOdwlZ1riZ.png" /></p>
<div>If you having issues with the setup, want to get some features implemented, need to get that one very important question answered or just want to chat to some of the people using my plugins?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Source: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/enchanter We use this plugin to easily enchant items with specific enchantments that can extend a long way beyond what vanilla minecraft allows, e.g. a make enchantment that would normally be limited to be 5 could be put to 10000, though that specific use is not recommended, it&#8217;s just an example.

<p>Hey everyone! I have here for you a simple plugin which lets you enchant your items.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s so cool about this plugin? <strong>You</strong> define how you add the enchantments by name!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/deFVe.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/deFVe.png" /></p>
<p>Cool, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Enchant your items!<br />
Customize names you can use to add enchantments!</p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p>enchanter.enchant<br />
lets you enchant your items<br />
enchanter.dirty<br />
lets you enchant items to levels above that enchantment&#8217;s normal level (up to level 127!)<br />
enchanter.reload<br />
lets you reload the list of names for enchantments</p>
<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>
<p><strong>/enchant &lt;enchantment&gt; &lt;level&gt;</strong><br />
Enchant your currently held item to the level you choose<br />
Examples:<br />
/enchant protect 3<br />
/enchant 49 1</p>
<p><strong>/enchant &lt;enchantment&gt; &lt;level&gt; max</strong><br />
Enchant your currently held item to the maximum natural level (highest you can get from a enchantment table!)<br />
Examples:<br />
/enchant sharpness max</p>
<p><strong>/enchant all</strong><br />
Enchant your currently held item with all enchantments to the highest level you can enchant to (Depending on permission enchanter.dirty)</p>
<p><strong>/enchant all natural</strong><br />
Enchant your currently held item with all enchantments to the highest in-game reachable levels</p>
<p><strong>Names</strong></p>
<p>You define what the enchantments can be called with in the commands! The file to edit is config.yml inside plugins/TimTheEnchanter folder. The plugin comes with some default names, only added on first run, and they are listed below. When a new enchantment comes out, be sure to add a new line for it! I will keep a list up to date below with the latest default names, so if an update comes out for Minecraft, check here for new enchantment names to add to the plugin&#8217;s config.yml</p>
