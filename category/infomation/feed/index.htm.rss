										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a list of all cheat detected and a description of what it is.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>AirJump :<br />
</strong>Allow to jump on the air.</p>
<p><strong>AirPlace :<br />
</strong>Allow to place block on air or next to liquid (instead of replace liquid).</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Knockback / Velocity / KB-Reduceur :<br />
</strong>Allow you to don&#8217;t flinch when you get hitting with object enchanted knockback . Feared in pitchout but very easy to see. Warning: some people don&#8217;t move because of lag, because it&#8217;s the player that send his position, so the server wait where the player got.</p>
<p><strong>AntiPotion :<br />
</strong>Remove bad potion effect like poison or blindness. Info: The player send packet according to the time of the potion effect. This say to the server to pass the time, and so remove the effect.</p>
<p><strong>AutoClick :<br />
</strong>Manage client click. Some client can just do like the player have 12 CPS constant (real player can do it also, so undetectable), but other allow just to go up to 20 CPS. Nb: CPS = Click Per Second.</p>
<p><strong>AutoSteal :<br />
</strong>Allow player to quickly edit inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Blink :<br />
</strong>Fake lag. Allow player to get teleported thanks to lag.</p>
<p><strong>Chat :<br />
</strong>Detect spam.</p>
<p><strong>Critical :<br />
</strong>Allow to always do critical damage, even on the ground without jumping.</p>
<p><strong>FastBow :<br />
</strong>Shoot a lot of arrow in no much time. Visible with the lag make by the player (spawn of many entities) and if you are spectate his inventory, you will see his bow self destruct.</p>
<p><strong>FastEat / AutoEat :<br />
</strong>Eat item instantly (and change slot of hand). Usually use in quick combat.</p>
<p><strong>FastLadder :<br />
</strong>Make the player moving very quickly when moving up on ladders.</p>
<p><strong>FastPlace / FastBreak :<br />
</strong>Place or break block faster than normal player.</p>
<p><strong>FastStairs :<br />
</strong>Equivalent of &#8216;SpeedHack&#8217; but for stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Fly :<br />
</strong>Allow player to fly. Some cheat make the player moving too fast, so it can be detected as Speed. There is also FlyNCP to fly on server who have NoCheatPlus plugin.</p>
<p><strong>ForceField / KillAura :</strong><br />
<em>In Negativity, both are together, but there is a different between us</em></p>
<p>KillAura make the player rotating to attack the player, and sometimes it contains &#8220;Reach&#8221; to hit someone at 5 or more blocks. ForceField simplify the attack. It allow to hit multiple entities at the same times without looking her.</p>
<p><strong>GroundSpoof :</strong><br />
Fake ground value of player to prevent fall damage or other features. Used for NoFall, Fly &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>InventoryMove :<br />
</strong>When you walk/sprint, you can open and click on your inventory (and always walk/sprint).</p>
<p><strong>Jesus / WaterWalk :<br />
</strong>Allow to walk or jump on water.</p>
<p><strong>NoFall :<br />
</strong>Remove damage effect from falling. Normally, everytime that your falling, your &#8220;fall damage&#8221; increase. This cheat don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><strong>NoPitchLimit :<br />
</strong>You can look 360° around you (in all direction)</p>
<p><strong>NoSlowDown :<br />
</strong>Move on soul sand like on basic blocs.</p>
<p><strong>NoWeb :<br />
</strong>Make you walk on cobweb exactly like on ground</p>
<p><strong>Nuker :<br />
</strong>Remove lot of block around her at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>PingSpoof :<br />
</strong>Fake the player ping.</p>
<p><strong>Phase :<br />
</strong>Make you walking ON blocks (or pass through it).</p>
<p><strong>Regen :<br />
</strong>Regen faster. Work exactly like AntiPotion.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffold :<br />
</strong>Make you placing block just behind you, but without looking it.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak :<br />
</strong>Allow you to sneak but you are moving as quickly as if you wasn&#8217;t sneaking</p>
<p><strong>Speed :<br />
</strong>Move faster.</p>
<p><strong>Spider :<br />
</strong>Allow you to walk on a wall like you walk on ground.</p>
<p><strong>Step :<br />
</strong>Teleport player on player, like if they have jump, but more than 1 block.</p>
<p><strong>Timer :<br />
</strong>Make the player game faster. Exactly like the player was in temporal loop, which make it does 1 minute in 10 seconds for other</p>
<p><strong>XRay :<br />
</strong>You only see diamond, emerald, iron, gold, restone and lapis (and other important block like spawner or new ore). All other blocks are just transparent.</p>The post <a href="https://cdn.floydcraft.co.uk/infomation/list-of-all-hacks-that-are-now-blocked-as-of-18th-april-2021/">list of all hacks that are now blocked as of 18th April 2021</a> first appeared on <a href="https://cdn.floydcraft.co.uk"> 𝙁𝙡𝙤𝙮𝙙 𝘾𝙧𝙖𝙛𝙩 </a>.]]></content:encoded>

If this is the first time you&#8217;ve hosted or managed your server and you aren&#8217;t sure what to do, you can make a custom request, just give us basic information on what you want, if you want and well get you set up.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dungeons on FloydCraft are custom made for player experience (not including DungeonWorld). They are in a variety of worlds and styles and most can be gotten to through /warp. New ones are constantly being added or changed, so keep an eye out!</p>
<p>The Dungeons range from easy that a recently new player could complete it to so difficult that you need friends. Their difficulty also scales their loot. So something easy will get you low-mid tier gear while a long and hard dungeon might get you end tier gear like mending or diamond or even netherite on the hardest ones!(once 1.16 is released and a affiliate dungeon is made upon update)</p>
<p>Dungeons restrict some powers when entering however, most disable fly,  god, heal, or /thru or /top in some cases. This is to provide balance with the limited AI of mobs in Minecraft. Whether you have nothing else to do or want a challenge try the dungeons some time! Might be worth the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our IP via Virgin Media was attacked by a who we believe to be a 15 year old playing from 174.255.197.256, he used to play on our Minecraft Server when he was 8 &#8211; 10, back then he was an average nice player who got along with everyone and now years later he came back only to start causing trouble, first he claimed that our server is insecure when we&#8217;ve been running our Minecraft server very successfully since early 2011 and he started trying to exploit the game, after failing that he then claims to have a way of ddosing people. Normally this would be something not so bad, one of the worse we&#8217;ve ever had was around 50 computers pinging at the same time, but this one however was around 5000+ active connections spamming random packets to everything on the network, he was able to take down Our Internet and the Free Internet we provide to our neighbors during the lockdown and froze everything to a halt, even a basic http request would take upto 30 seconds to gather a response (not including its content) and we have a £1200 Network switch by Netgear we got from a local computer recycling centre and even that was flooded due to the packets bouncing around from the router, resulting in local network shares becoming inaccessible whilst connected to the Virgin Media Router, This caused a lot of problems for not only us but also for our Players all the way in the US and Germany, Our neighbors using our Free Lockdown Wifi, Family members gaming online and others streaming music/YouTube. Here&#8217;s a total of everyone this effected (Playing Minecraft: 5 | Playing Online Games: 1 | Using our Free Wifi 6 | streaming YouTube: 2) that&#8217;s 14 people lost there access multiple times because of this 15 year olds fun, However the way this attack specifically was run shows that he has Infected many computers in order to create his BotNet, Each incoming packet was from a different IP, and a quick nmap on a few of these IP&#8217;s shows them to be just basic home users, no servers or anything like that, just people that he has managed to get to install a piece of software containing the malicious BotNet server. There&#8217;s not really any way of notifying the infected users as we only have there IP and his botnet will only grow bigger unless this is looked into further by the proper authority<br />
For now we are checking out the IP&#8217;s he has connected on in the past using a slow Nmap scan to trackdown his current and previous ISP and have someone to get information him including location<br />
Below are times of attacks so far:<br />
Time of attack 1 (around 1400 IP&#8217;s spamming packets)<br />
Started 6:56PM &#8211; 6:57PM<br />
Time of attack 2 (upto 3000 IP&#8217;s Spamming Packets)<br />
Started at 6:57PM and ended at 7:00PM<br />
Time of attack 3 (around 5000 IP&#8217;s spamming packets)<br />
Started at 7:23PM and ended at 7:39PM<br />
Time of attack 4 (arround 1400 IP&#8217;s spamming packets)<br />
Started at 7:56PM and ended at 7:58PM</p>
<p>Edit:<br />
27/05/2020 logged into minecraft server with the name &#8220;nigger&#8221; from an AT&amp;T Mobile conection, The location service matches his location in</p>
